Vision:

The vision of the S.AI.R team is to showcase an innovative approach in aerospace technology by integrating Android-based smartphones as mission computers in fixed-wing UAVs and developing associated software. By closely following technological advancements, we aim to achieve high rankings in international competitions like TEKNOFEST and promote Yıldız Technical University's name on both national and global platforms. As students from the Mechatronics Engineering and Mathematics Engineering departments at Yıldız Technical University, we adopt a multidisciplinary approach to realize this vision.

Mission:

The mission of the S.AI.R team is to combine our engineering and mathematical knowledge to effectively utilize Android-based smartphones as mission computers for fixed-wing UAVs. Supported by TÜBİTAK 2209, our project aims to develop innovative and cost-effective mission computers by leveraging the high efficiency and low energy consumption advantages of Android phones. In the TEKNOFEST combat UAV competition, we are committed to showcasing our engineering and mathematical skills and achieving successful results. To this end, we focus on developing effective and sustainable solutions both technically and practically.
